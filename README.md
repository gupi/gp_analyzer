REDAXO Addon to analyze a REDAXO 4 based WEB-Site to identify required adjustmets to Modules and Templates prior to REDAXO 5 upgrade

Next steps:

1st - cleanup r4 export code (low priority)

2nd - upload r5 import Addon to GitHub

3rd - extend r5 importer with the module and template converter

Note: currently the r4 exporter contains only a sub-set of contents conversion features. These are for testing only and will be removed as soon as the r5 converter is finished.
